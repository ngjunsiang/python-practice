    "# Caesar cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "A Caesar cipher is an encryption method that replaces each plaintext letter with a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a 5-letter shift results in `'a'` being replaced with `'f'`, `'b'` being replaced with `'g'`, `'y'` being replaced with `'d'`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the Caesar cipher as a class, `CaesarCipher`. The class should be instantiated with an integer that represents the number of positions to shift each letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class should implement two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `encode()`, which takes in a plaintext string and returns it in encoded form\n",
    "- `decode()`, which takes in an encoded string and returns it in decoded form\n",
    "\n",
    "Punctuation and other symbols should not be shifted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example output:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> cipher = CaesarCipher(7)\n",
    "    >>> inputstr = 'If he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, that is, by so changing the order of the letters of the alphabet, that not a word could be made out.'\n",
    "    >>> encodedstr = cipher.encode(inputstr)\n",
    "    >>> encodedstr\n",
    "    'Pm ol ohk hufaopun jvumpkluaphs av zhf, ol dyval pa pu jpwoly, aoha pz, if zv johunpun aol vykly vm aol slaalyz vm aol hswohila, aoha uva h dvyk jvbsk il thkl vba.'\n",
    "    >>> cipher.decode(encodedstr)\n",
    "    'If he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, that is, by so changing the order of the letters of the alphabet, that not a word could be made out.'\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\* Tip: You can use `ord()` to convert a string character to its ASCII character code (integer), and `chr()` to convert a character code back to its letter representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extended challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add a keyword argument, `matchcase=` that preserves the case of each character if set to `True`.\n",
    "2. Implement the character-shifting code using a Queue data structure. You may use a Circular Linked List to allow the Queue to loop back to the start after the last character."
